# STATS 80 BLACKJACK PROJECT

## Purpose

This project is designed to simulate a "hit" in the game of Blackjack.  
This will be done primarily using R and, if I have time, Python.  
The probability of staying under 21 after hitting for various hand values will be simulated and measured. The average hand value after hitting will also be measured through simulation.
